## Project Overview
This repository is a focused data pre-processing utility for cleaning bilingual (Nepali-English) Excel files. The main script is `preprocessing.py`, which reads an input Excel file, applies a series of text normalization and filtering heuristics, and writes a cleaned output Excel file. The workflow is designed to preserve alignment between language pairs while removing noise and invalid data.

## Key Files
- `preprocessing.py`: Main script for all data processing logic.
- `input.xlsx`: Example input file (bilingual, Nepali-English).
- `output.xlsx`: Output file generated by the script.

## Core Workflow
- Run the script from the command line, specifying input and output Excel file paths and (optionally) column names and filtering parameters.
- The script expects columns named `Nepal` (Nepali text) and `English` (English text) by default, but these can be overridden with arguments.
- Data is filtered by:
  - Removing rows with blank or nonsense text (using Unicode heuristics)
  - Removing rows where Nepali contains English letters
  - Removing rows with disallowed characters in Nepali
  - Dropping duplicate sentence pairs (optionally case-insensitive)
- Output preserves the original column order and writes to Excel using `openpyxl`.

## Usage Example
```sh
python preprocessing.py input.xlsx output.xlsx --nepali_col=Nepal --english_col=English
```

## Project-Specific Patterns
- All text normalization and filtering logic is in `preprocessing.py`.
- Uses regular expressions for Unicode and language-specific filtering.
- No external configuration files; all parameters are via CLI arguments.
- No test suite or build system; run the script directly.
- Only dependency is `pandas` (and `openpyxl` for Excel I/O).

## Conventions
- Nepali text is expected in Devanagari Unicode range.
- English text is expected to be Latin script.
- All data cleaning is non-destructive to column order and non-target columns.

## Integration Points
- No external APIs or services; all processing is local and file-based.
- Designed for batch, not interactive, use.

## Extending
- Add new filters or normalization steps in `preprocessing.py`.
- To support new file formats, extend the I/O logic in the main script.
